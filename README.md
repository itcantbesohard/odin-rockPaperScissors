# Rock–Paper–Scissors (Console Version)
This project is a simple JavaScript implementation of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game. The player competes against the computer in a 5‑round match, with results displayed directly in the browser console.

## How It Works
- The game runs automatically when the script loads (playGame()).
- Each round:
- The player enters a choice: 1‑Rock, 2‑Paper, 3‑Scissors (or types the word).
- The computer randomly selects its move.
- The winner of the round is determined and scores are updated.
- After 5 rounds, the final result is shown in the console.

## Features
- Input validation for both numbers and text.
- Randomized computer choices.
- Clear round‑by‑round feedback.
- Final score summary after all rounds.

## How to Play
- Open the project in a browser.
- Open the Console (F12 → Console tab).
- Follow the prompts and enter your choices.
- Watch the results appear in the console.
